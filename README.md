# Face-mask-detection-model
In this project, we are training the image dataset which are classified as With Mask (1000 images) and Without mask(1000 images) extracted from Kaggle source, using deep learning based CNN (Convolution Neural Network) model for detecting whether a person is wearing mask or not.
CNN is being chosen by us because of its simple network model and better augmentation (Non- overfitting or Non- underfitting).
